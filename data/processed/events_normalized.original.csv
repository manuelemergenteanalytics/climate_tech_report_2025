IGNIA's social investment focus is to fight poverty by developing profitable, highly scalable businesses that serve the needs of the Base of the Pyramid population in areas of exceptional need including health, housing, and education. These businesses provide services and products that ultimately improve the quality of life of the BoP and enable them to generate wealth for themselves. The B Corp certification provides a standard, credible means for investors and partners to recognize IGNIA's commitment not only to deliver substantial social change in our core business of investing in the BoP, but also in how we treat our employees, environment, and stakeholders.The Change We Seek™ By providing effective responses to the enormously underserved needs of low income populations, both as consumers as well as active participants in productive value chains, IGNIA empowers entrepreneurship and generates social impact while creating attractive financial returns for its investors. The largest market in Latin America is comprised of people who earn less than US$3,000 per year. These 360 million people represent the BoP market, which, in aggregate, is estimated at US$510 Billion. By providing capital to businesses in this marketplace, we enrich the community to higher standards of living while at the same time using this goal to attract investors and create a profitable return. IGNIA believes that the only way to address the poverty disparity in the BoP and tap into the aggregate market presence is through business. This is not achieved through one firm, but through the creation of an industry, which is the natural outgrowth of an economic activity which generates levels of profitability equal or higher than those with the same risk profile. IGNIA is jump-starting this industry and opening the door for other sources of capital to support impoverished regions of Mexico.","Source=bcorp | sector: Financial & insurance activities | description: IGNIA is a venture capital investment firm that supports the founding and expansion of high growth social enterprises that serve the base of the socio-economic pyramid (BoP) in Latin America.

Echale’s sustainable housing model brings a systemic solution for the selfbuilder families. Becoming a B Corp certifies that that both the economic and social values of our model are part of our mission and rates our effectiveness in accomplishing them. The Change We Seek In spite of unprecedented economic and demographic growth over the past several years, many developing nations are confronted with the perpetual problem of housing. Today there is a total housing deficit of over 400 million around the world. In order to cope with a flawed housing delivery system, most families construct their own homes magnifying the problem since materials are inherently expensive and financing for this segment of the market is limited. Thus, housing fails to fulfill its basic economic function of building household wealth and falls short in its social function. Echale Tu Casa seeks to revert this vicious cycle by correcting the flaws inherent to the self-build process, thus allowing it to deliver returns on economic, social, and environmental levels. Through Echale’s innovative model, families can build their own home becoming proprietors of a patrimony that they can count on and inherit to the next generation. Securing a house provides families, and entire communities, the opportunity to focus on their development and househols wealth","Source=bcorp | sector: Construction | description: Echale a Tu Casa is a social housing production company that delivers affordable homes to communities through the implementation of innovations in construction, technology and finance.

Originally built over two strong pillars (a new model of fair relationship with its suppliers – native Amazon communities – and strong investment in R&D to create added value and high nutritional value products made with native Amazon Fruits - mainly Brazil Nut and Açai Berry), The company, now is part of Grupo Orsa, promotes regional development through the sustainable use of natural resources. Based on fair commerce practices and training programs for gathering, storage and sale of raw Amazonian Fruits, our company was an innovator in developing an equitable and harmonious relationship with the indigenous communities, family farmers and rubber collectors. Thanks to its practices, Ouro Verde Amazonia earned organic certification for the entire product line from Ecocert Brasil. Over its nine years of existence, the company has consolidated a business model that stood out for its distinctive relationship with the traditional communities of the Amazon, including several indigenous ethnic groups, residents of several Resex (Federal Extractive Reserves) and smallholder farmers. This unique model was guided by the fair-trade and above-average prices paid to suppliers. In Brazil, the extraction of Brazil Nut is characterized by high concentration of production in a few states; the Acre, Amazonas and Pará hold 80.7% of production. Other states (Rondonia, Mato Grosso, Amapa and Roraima) must share the remaining 19.3%. The Northern Region is responsible for 98.72% of national production of Brazil nut, with direct impacts on the lives of extractive communities, small farmers and indigenous people. Through fair trade and ethical practices, Ouro Verde seeks to create more positive impacts in these communities, as well as for consumers. We believe in a new business model in which sharing benefits, ethical approach and solidarity are the strong bases that should support these “new generation companies.” The ending and fair financial result, which is essential for the longevity of the companies, should be an obvious and necessary result of this equation. By becoming a B Corp, we would like to share these principles with other “sister companies” around the world, learn alternative ways to reinforce these kind of principles, and add an additional water drop to the B Corporations Initiatives by sharing our history .The Change We Seek Ouro Verde Amazonia believes that one of the biggest challenges for the future of the Amazon region is to reorder old regional supply chains of its native products, like Açai Berry and Brazil Nut. These supply chains are historically characterized as unbalanced and unfair; by consolidating them in a new business model, they can be made more sustainable and harmonious by sharing the benefits of producing some of the healthiest nature foods with the native Amazonian communities. Implementation of this sustainable business model would generate at least three clear benefits: better life for local Amazon communities, maintenance of the majestic Amazon Forest (no deforestation) and widespread supply of highly healthy food (Açai and Brazil Nut) for consumers around the world. For Ouro Verde, and for all those interested in preserving the world’s largest tropical forest, production of goods made from the Brazil nut is a question of believing in a better future. The mission is to combine economic satisfaction with environmental protection, emphasizing a profound respect for nature and generating opportunities for all suppliers, employees and consumers through the practice of fair trade, ethical values and high quality services.",Source=bcorp | sector: Manufactured Goods | description: Ouro Verde Amazonia Ouro Verde Amazonia is a company created in 2002 by young entrepreneurs in the heart of the Amazon region.

Unlike traditional student lenders, they fundamentally align the interest of their investors and students in a win-win relationship that benefits everyone. Lumni's investment funds don't make loans. Instead, students commit a fixed percentage of income for the 10 years after they graduate. This dramatically reduces the risk of unmanageable payments after graduation in the case of unemployment or underemployment, giving debt-averse, underserved college students the comfort to take a leap. Lumni also employs an innovative underwriting process, determining creditworthiness not on access to co-signer like traditional lenders, but instead on a student's personal drive and potential. This allows Lumni to identify qualified clients from with the country's most underserved populations, students who would be deemed too risky by private lenders. Finally, Lumni distinguishes itself by building a relationship with its students and supporting them with career coaching and development services.","Source=bcorp | sector: Financial & insurance activities | description: Lumni is a new kind of financial services company dedicated to ensuring that students everywhere can leverage their most valuable asset - their own future potential - to access financing for college.

Their mission is to improve people’s academic and vocational skills through technology. Enova’s solution to these challenges is the Red de Innovación y Aprendizaje (RIA), or the Learning and Innovation Network. The network includes a chain of 70 educational centers that provide low-income Mexican communities with quality educational opportunities and access to information technologies. The network is expanding quickly, with 25 Digital Libraries inaugurated in 2013. Every week 3,000 individuals sign up at the RIA centers to become members. Enova's differentiating strategy is that in addition to providing users with access to technology, it develops the tools needed to use it effectively and incorporate the necessary elements for effective learning. The model integrates four main components: 1) access to robust IT infrastructure, 2) selection and development of relevant educational content for all ages, ranging from basic competencies to use of technology and English as a second language 3) a blended e-learning model with skilled facilitators, and 4) analysis of each student’s performance to revise and improve course content. We feel that it is important to be part of a group that shares our vision of having a high social impact while creating value. As we continue to grow, it will be increasingly important that we act transparently and be held accountable.

The academic programs are taught through the use of technology and facilitators to assure that every student succeeds.

The solution combines vermicomposting with poverty eradication in vulnerable rural and urban areas, helps the populations to address imperative issues such as food security and environmental pollution and, educates farmers on how to avoid the dependency of chemical fertilizer. Red worms (Eisenia Fetida) are the agents of change because it is through their digestion process, that biodegradable waste is transformed into 100% organic fertilizer. This technique is well known and holds the capacity for more environmentally friendly waste management while at the same time empowers women and disadvantaged communities to make sustainable livelihood out of waste. Byoearth’s mission is to enable users to generate valuable products out of waste: solid organic fertilizer, worm tea fertilizer and worms themselves because economic, social and environmental impact can come directly from this and the solution is replicable worldwide! The Change We Seek ByoEarth educates local communities on the importance of biodegradable waste management and provides technical training in adopting vermicomposting. ”I want people in Guatemala to know that waste is really wealth,” Maria states. There is a way for them to generate an income and be environmentally sustainable by selling and using vermicompost. Byoearth wants groups and individuals throughout Guatemala to adopt this process because it “returns organic fertilizers to the earth.” Three different communities near Guatemala City have banded together to tackle their mounting waste problem. They invested in the vermicomposting process and began converting their organic waste into fertilizer, while also generating a key source of income. The main objectives of ByoEarth include:Enhanced, sustainable agricultural productivityGreater food security for the local communityLand use sustainability ByoEarth’s 5-year vision is to enable more than 10,000 Guatemalan farmers to reduce their dependence on and usage of chemical fertilizers. “I want to take nature’s processes and maximize them,” Maria concludes. The task is to continue to explore ways in which communities can use nature’s processes in sustainable and even profitable ways.” Why We Became a B Corp We became a B Corp because we want to make a real change in Guatemala, and we think that becoming part of this community of social entrepreneurs will serve as a learning platform to engage with new partners, improve our performance and enhance our impact.","Source=bcorp | sector: Manufactured Goods | description: ByoEarth promotes vermicomposting and its organic fertilizer in rural and urban communities in order to improve the living conditions of vulnerable populations.

Lumni also employs an innovative underwriting process, determining creditworthiness not on access to co-signer like traditional lenders, but instead on a student's personal drive and potential.

Some of these questions are:Why have children lost the shine in their eyes?Why is there so much frustration?Why are illness, violence and destruction normal?Why are we destroying nature?Why have we lost our essence… our principles, in other words, our values and habits? Flowing has found some answers to these questions… something happened, they suddenly changed their beliefs thinking that love is overprotection, life should be easy, fast and effortless, success is having a lot of money and so on… these beliefs have generated negative consequences in children, youth, adults, nature and society… people have lost their harmony. The principal tool used in Flowing to give solutions to these questions has been the Langford Method created by Sylvia Langford during 30 years of observation and work. She states that an entrepreneur is a person that is happy, because he/she has a dream and works everyday to make it come true. An entrepreneur is a leader of his/her life, values teamwork, respects nature, has habits and principles, develops skills and lives in harmony. The Langford Method is an innovative concrete proposal that has three focuses:Understand the importance of being an authority or leader.Give a concrete and practical proposal to work with children and youth: human development and the essence of being an entrepreneur.Understand the importance of leadership and teamwork. Since 2009 the Langford Method has been officially applied in 180 schools, kindergartens, universities and children homes throughout Chile from La Serena down to Punta Arenas. Since 2013, Flowing has begun working with enterprises. This year all of their books and materials are being translated into English to face demands in English speaking countries during 2016. Over 12,000 children, youth, their parents and teachers have worked with the method. Around 30,000 people have attended talks. There has been great interest to know more about Flowing's proposal in books they have published, articles and interviews in magazines, press, radio and TV.The Change We Seek Flowing is working hard on changing beliefs. They believe that:A leader must be calm, patient, precise in his instructions, close, systematic and coherent in order to be capable of solving conflicts through dialogue and understanding.Happiness is a choice; it is a way of living.Dreams come true with systematic work, effort and discipline.Sustainability will allow them to take care of the planet.An entrepreneur is a person that builds is life day-by-day.Teamwork is collaborative work.Love is: trust, listening, respect, empathy and developing autonomy.","Source=bcorp | sector: Education | description: Flowing asks questions, looks for answers and gives solutions to what they live day by day in their homes, schools, nature and society.

Originally built over two strong pillars (a new model of fair relationship with its suppliers – native Amazon communities – and strong investment in R&D to create added value and high nutritional value products made with native Amazon Fruits - mainly Brazil Nut and Açai Berry), The company, now is part of Grupo Orsa, promotes regional development through the sustainable use of natural resources. Based on fair commerce practices and training programs for gathering, storage and sale of raw Amazonian Fruits, our company was an innovator in developing an equitable and harmonious relationship with the indigenous communities, family farmers and rubber collectors. Thanks to its practices, Ouro Verde Amazonia earned organic certification for the entire product line from Ecocert Brasil. Over its nine years of existence, the company has consolidated a business model that stood out for its distinctive relationship with the traditional communities of the Amazon, including several indigenous ethnic groups, residents of several Resex (Federal Extractive Reserves) and smallholder farmers. This unique model was guided by the fair-trade and above-average prices paid to suppliers. In Brazil, the extraction of Brazil Nut is characterized by high concentration of production in a few states; the Acre, Amazonas and Pará hold 80.7% of production. Other states (Rondonia, Mato Grosso, Amapa and Roraima) must share the remaining 19.3%. The Northern Region is responsible for 98.72% of national production of Brazil nut, with direct impacts on the lives of extractive communities, small farmers and indigenous people. Through fair trade and ethical practices, Ouro Verde seeks to create more positive impacts in these communities, as well as for consumers. We believe in a new business model in which sharing benefits, ethical approach and solidarity are the strong bases that should support these “new generation companies.” The ending and fair financial result, which is essential for the longevity of the companies, should be an obvious and necessary result of this equation. By becoming a B Corp, we would like to share these principles with other “sister companies” around the world, learn alternative ways to reinforce these kind of principles, and add an additional water drop to the B Corporations Initiatives by sharing our history .The Change We Seek Ouro Verde Amazonia believes that one of the biggest challenges for the future of the Amazon region is to reorder old regional supply chains of its native products, like Açai Berry and Brazil Nut. These supply chains are historically characterized as unbalanced and unfair; by consolidating them in a new business model, they can be made more sustainable and harmonious by sharing the benefits of producing some of the healthiest nature foods with the native Amazonian communities. Implementation of this sustainable business model would generate at least three clear benefits: better life for local Amazon communities, maintenance of the majestic Amazon Forest (no deforestation) and widespread supply of highly healthy food (Açai and Brazil Nut) for consumers around the world. For Ouro Verde, and for all those interested in preserving the world’s largest tropical forest, production of goods made from the Brazil nut is a question of believing in a better future. The mission is to combine economic satisfaction with environmental protection, emphasizing a profound respect for nature and generating opportunities for all suppliers, employees and consumers through the practice of fair trade, ethical values and high quality services.",Source=bcorp | sector: Manufactured Goods | description: Ouro Verde Amazonia Ouro Verde Amazonia is a company created in 2002 by young entrepreneurs in the heart of the Amazon region.

IGNIA's social investment focus is to fight poverty by developing profitable, highly scalable businesses that serve the needs of the Base of the Pyramid population in areas of exceptional need including health, housing, and education. These businesses provide services and products that ultimately improve the quality of life of the BoP and enable them to generate wealth for themselves. The B Corp certification provides a standard, credible means for investors and partners to recognize IGNIA's commitment not only to deliver substantial social change in our core business of investing in the BoP, but also in how we treat our employees, environment, and stakeholders.The Change We Seek™ By providing effective responses to the enormously underserved needs of low income populations, both as consumers as well as active participants in productive value chains, IGNIA empowers entrepreneurship and generates social impact while creating attractive financial returns for its investors. The largest market in Latin America is comprised of people who earn less than US$3,000 per year. These 360 million people represent the BoP market, which, in aggregate, is estimated at US$510 Billion. By providing capital to businesses in this marketplace, we enrich the community to higher standards of living while at the same time using this goal to attract investors and create a profitable return. IGNIA believes that the only way to address the poverty disparity in the BoP and tap into the aggregate market presence is through business. This is not achieved through one firm, but through the creation of an industry, which is the natural outgrowth of an economic activity which generates levels of profitability equal or higher than those with the same risk profile. IGNIA is jump-starting this industry and opening the door for other sources of capital to support impoverished regions of Mexico.","Source=bcorp | sector: Financial & insurance activities | description: IGNIA is a venture capital investment firm that supports the founding and expansion of high growth social enterprises that serve the base of the socio-economic pyramid (BoP) in Latin America.

The menstrual cup is a healthy friendly option for their reusable quality, environmental and cost savings. It is produced with hypoallergenic medical grade silicone, brought from Germany. With its use, deforestation and waste generation caused by other options, such as tampons and towels, they are fully avoid. Our goal is to empower women through sound management period. Positive environmental impact: The use of the menstrual cup would save 132,000 tons of non-recyclable waste. From 2013 to 2015, 12,000 cups Maggacup leads sold and avoided 85 million pathological waste menstrual hygiene. In March 2014, Maggacup signed an agreement with the NGO Forest Bank, with the commitment that each mug sold Ong donate to an amount equivalent to 1m2 of the missionary forest. In addition, use of the menstrual cup reduces carbon footprint is also reduced in buying imported menstrual cups. Positive impact social / community: There are women who do not have access to the financial means to stock up on cosmetics. They also lack access to toilets where they can be changed in suitably hygienic conditions and privacy. They are women who use what they have on hand, tea, cotton or mud. About 60% of these women believed that menstrual blood is harmful substances and that his greatest fear is smeared during menstruation, we can infer that the lack of information and embarrassment about menstruation go hand in hand. Positive impact on people: Maggacup already has more than 12 thousand users of menstrual cup. Its use provides several benefits:Care about women (The conventional feminine hygiene products have chemicals that are used for perfuming them, preserve them and blanch).Helps your personal economy (Investment spending on the purchase of the product pays for itself in about 10 months implying a saving of 400% over the annual budget of menstrual pads and tampons.Practicality and comfort.Promotes and requires the entry of the vagina in the body schema and manipulation of menstruation.

Maggacup is important to strengthen membership in the community, also improving their personal and family finances ally. We believe that the initiators also as agents of change in their community where they generate a positive transformation. Under the World Day of menstrual hygiene initiative of German NGOs United Wash, with the aim of publicizing the fundamentals of menstrual hygiene in the economy, health, education, environment and human rights; Maggacup from an activity performed in public roads, in the interest of advancing the cause At first launch of the business, we have taken significant discounts, which then planned climb.

It has impact in three levels: individual, community and humanity. Individually speaking, it impacts positivily in the self-esteem, in the sexual and reproductive health, resulting in the woman²s empowerment. At the comunity level, the effect of individual empowerment, is families and insititutions empowerment; and active citizen participation bio-social-educational. And because of the preservation and restitution of the environment, we get the humanity empowerment (ex: Girl Effect, www.girleffect.org). Magga means ""way in the middle"" and it is our mantra. We are a social and economic company and both aspects have the same value for us and are permanently interacting and balancing. While the menstrual cup is starting to have the largest circulation in Argentina, most women are using pads and tampons. Argentina In a year generates 3.38 billion units in wipes and tampons. They are products with very short shelf life and are pathogenic wastes that are not treatable or recyclable by waste collection systems. They are hazardous materials because they can be infected with infectious diseases. Furthermore, the raw material for the production of wipes and pads is Kraft pulp or fluff pulp involving 60% of the weight of these methods. Produced from the monoculture of exotic trees. Which it is associated with harmful effects on soil, waterways, vegetation and native fauna. In conclusion, consumption of wipes and tampons mean consumption of the planet's resources and degradation.The INTI (National Institute of Industrial Technology) tested for health fitness of the raw material used to manufacture according to the criteria and standards of the European Pharmacopoeia.The Faculty of Pharmacy and Biochemistry of the UBA (University of Buenos Aires) conducted testings of skin irritation.The industrial design of Maggacup is patented and registered with the INPI (National Institute of Industrial Property).Maggacup is registered in the National Administration of Drugs, Food and Medical Technology (ANMAT).","Source=bcorp | sector: Retail | description: Maggacup Argentina is the first company dedicated to the production and sale of the menstrual cup, an innovative and sustainable product Women period.

Instead, students commit a fixed percentage of income for the 10 years after they graduate.

With its use, deforestation and waste generation caused by other options, such as tampons and towels, they are fully avoid. Our goal is to empower women through sound management period. Positive environmental impact: The use of the menstrual cup would save 132,000 tons of non-recyclable waste. From 2013 to 2015, 12,000 cups Maggacup leads sold and avoided 85 million pathological waste menstrual hygiene. In March 2014, Maggacup signed an agreement with the NGO Forest Bank, with the commitment that each mug sold Ong donate to an amount equivalent to 1m2 of the missionary forest. In addition, use of the menstrual cup reduces carbon footprint is also reduced in buying imported menstrual cups. Positive impact social / community: There are women who do not have access to the financial means to stock up on cosmetics. They also lack access to toilets where they can be changed in suitably hygienic conditions and privacy. They are women who use what they have on hand, tea, cotton or mud. About 60% of these women believed that menstrual blood is harmful substances and that his greatest fear is smeared during menstruation, we can infer that the lack of information and embarrassment about menstruation go hand in hand. Positive impact on people: Maggacup already has more than 12 thousand users of menstrual cup. Its use provides several benefits:Care about women (The conventional feminine hygiene products have chemicals that are used for perfuming them, preserve them and blanch).Helps your personal economy (Investment spending on the purchase of the product pays for itself in about 10 months implying a saving of 400% over the annual budget of menstrual pads and tampons.Practicality and comfort.Promotes and requires the entry of the vagina in the body schema and manipulation of menstruation.

It has impact in three levels: individual, community and humanity. Individually speaking, it impacts positivily in the self-esteem, in the sexual and reproductive health, resulting in the woman²s empowerment. At the comunity level, the effect of individual empowerment, is families and insititutions empowerment; and active citizen participation bio-social-educational.

We are a social and economic company and both aspects have the same value for us and are permanently interacting and balancing. While the menstrual cup is starting to have the largest circulation in Argentina, most women are using pads and tampons. Argentina In a year generates 3.38 billion units in wipes and tampons. They are products with very short shelf life and are pathogenic wastes that are not treatable or recyclable by waste collection systems. They are hazardous materials because they can be infected with infectious diseases. Furthermore, the raw material for the production of wipes and pads is Kraft pulp or fluff pulp involving 60% of the weight of these methods. Produced from the monoculture of exotic trees.

Instead, students commit a fixed percentage of income for the 10 years after they graduate.

Echale’s sustainable housing model brings a systemic solution for the selfbuilder families. Becoming a B Corp certifies that that both the economic and social values of our model are part of our mission and rates our effectiveness in accomplishing them. The Change We Seek In spite of unprecedented economic and demographic growth over the past several years, many developing nations are confronted with the perpetual problem of housing. Today there is a total housing deficit of over 400 million around the world. In order to cope with a flawed housing delivery system, most families construct their own homes magnifying the problem since materials are inherently expensive and financing for this segment of the market is limited. Thus, housing fails to fulfill its basic economic function of building household wealth and falls short in its social function. Echale Tu Casa seeks to revert this vicious cycle by correcting the flaws inherent to the self-build process, thus allowing it to deliver returns on economic, social, and environmental levels. Through Echale’s innovative model, families can build their own home becoming proprietors of a patrimony that they can count on and inherit to the next generation.

Faro's customers save on energy bills, reduce energy price volatility and increase independence from the grid. Faro's investors benefit from stable, long term returns on their investment. Faro Energy partners with a network of local engineers and developers across the region, bringing together the best local knowledge and engineering skills with international capital and solar expertise. Faro Energy was known as Iwana Energy until June 2016 Faro Energy aims to accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy, by bringing innovative solar financing models to new markets. In many emerging markets, solar is already cost-competitive with grid power without subsidy. However, most energy consumers (of all sizes) want to pay for their energy as they use it rather than incurring large upfront costs. This makes lack of access to capital is one of the biggest barriers to rapid roll-out of solar. Ultimately, Faro aims to catalyse a large scale shift in global capital flows to a low carbon economy, by creating attractive, large scale investment opportunities - turning clean energy infrastructure in developing countries into a mainstream investment asset.","Source=bcorp | sector: Energy | description: Faro Energy provides fully financed onsite solar systems to companies across Latin America.

Becoming a B Corp certifies that that both the economic and social values of our model are part of our mission and rates our effectiveness in accomplishing them. The Change We Seek In spite of unprecedented economic and demographic growth over the past several years, many developing nations are confronted with the perpetual problem of housing. Today there is a total housing deficit of over 400 million around the world. In order to cope with a flawed housing delivery system, most families construct their own homes magnifying the problem since materials are inherently expensive and financing for this segment of the market is limited. Thus, housing fails to fulfill its basic economic function of building household wealth and falls short in its social function. Echale Tu Casa seeks to revert this vicious cycle by correcting the flaws inherent to the self-build process, thus allowing it to deliver returns on economic, social, and environmental levels. Through Echale’s innovative model, families can build their own home becoming proprietors of a patrimony that they can count on and inherit to the next generation.

Unlike traditional student lenders, they fundamentally align the interest of their investors and students in a win-win relationship that benefits everyone. Lumni's investment funds don't make loans. Instead, students commit a fixed percentage of income for the 10 years after they graduate. This dramatically reduces the risk of unmanageable payments after graduation in the case of unemployment or underemployment, giving debt-averse, underserved college students the comfort to take a leap. Lumni also employs an innovative underwriting process, determining creditworthiness not on access to co-signer like traditional lenders, but instead on a student's personal drive and potential. This allows Lumni to identify qualified clients from with the country's most underserved populations, students who would be deemed too risky by private lenders. Finally, Lumni distinguishes itself by building a relationship with its students and supporting them with career coaching and development services.","Source=bcorp | sector: Financial & insurance activities | description: Lumni is a new kind of financial services company dedicated to ensuring that students everywhere can leverage their most valuable asset - their own future potential - to access financing for college.
